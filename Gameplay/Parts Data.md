# Parts
## What the heck are "Parts"?
Parts are all the things unique to **Going Over Niagara Falls in a Barrel Simulator**, the barrels themselves, the barrel accessories, powerups, and cosmetics that don't come standard in Roblox but are needed to make this XP work.

## Barrels
Barrels will take a certain amount of battering before they break entirely.
The player bounces around inside, which may injure them.

- **Old Barrel**
  This is the starter barrel that you get for free. It smells like pickles.
  You can find these laying around for free pretty much anywhere.
  0 R$
- **Steel Drum**
  The American Standard Barrel. It's uncomfortable, inconvenient, and indestructible.
  *To unlock*: Injure every part of your body at least once.
- **Bathtub**
  Not very glamorous, but imagine the spectacle.
  *To unlock*: be the last person over the falls 100 times.
  800 R$

## Accessories
- **Oar**
  Slightly more effective than flailing impotently with your bare hands.
- **Inner Net**
  You bounce around a little less, so you get injured slightly less severely.
- **Keel Reinforcement**
  Boosts the barrel's battering threshold.

## Powerups
Powerups mostly affect the efficacy of your paddling.

- **"Death Wish"**
  Your disregard for life allows you to plunge towards death more swiftly
- **Buttered Up**
  Your barrel must have had a past life as a brewing vessel, cuz it has a little "kick" to it.

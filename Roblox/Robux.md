**Robux** is denoted by the symbol `R$`.
This symbol is contentious, since it is also used with the [Brazillian real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real).
It has been the in-game currency of Roblox since 14 May, 2007.

All paid items in the avatar shop are sold for Robux, including user-created content such as microtransactions and game passes.

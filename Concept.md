# Concept
The overall idea is very simple:
1. Players join the server and enter the game lobby (the Goat Island Parking Lot).
2. From the lobby, players can choose their barrel, manage their equipment, or seek medical attention.
3. Game rounds begin at regular intervals- all players who want to participate in the next round make their way to the edge of the river and board their barrels.
4. When the game round begins, all players by the river's edge are dropped into the river in their barrels and they begin floating towards the falls.
	1. Obstacles are randomly placed in the river each round.
	2. Crashing into obstacles can damage your barrel or cause you injury.
	3. Some of the obstacles are police officers who will try to fish you out of the water.
	4. If the police catch you, they will fine you and send you back to the lobby.
	5. If you go over the falls (and retain consciousness), you will recieve donations from thrilled onlookers that you can use to fix/upgrade your barrel or pay doctors to heal any injuries you've sustained. After going over the falls and emerging from the rapids below, you are taken back to the lobby.
	6. If you become so injured that you lose consciousness, you are sent back to the lobby.
5. After all players return to the lobby, the cycle begins again from step 2.
6. Repeat ad naseaous.

![Niagara Falls](Niagara_01.jpg)
The Goat Island Parking Lot (large center island) is the location of the game lobby.
The Horseshoe falls (right) is where the players plunge into infamy.
The American falls (left) are not used, since the fall there has a 100% fatality rate.

Perhaps if we start the players far enough up river they'll be presented with a choice to go down either horseshoe falls (probable victory) or american falls (certain death). This necessitates a very long float downriver before finally plunging - the opportunity for a joke might not be worth the hassle.

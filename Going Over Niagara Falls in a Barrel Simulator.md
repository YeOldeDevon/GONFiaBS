## Overview
During the 19th and 20th century, it was a popular and highly visible daredevil stunt to attempt a "plunge" over Niagara Falls into the rapids below. Since 1850, more than 5,000 people have gone over the falls either as stunts, suicide attempts, or accidents. Supposedly only 16 people have survived the feat. In 1951 the stunt was outlawed in both America and Canada, carrying a fine of up to $25,000 plus rescue fees.

These odds may seem bleak, but if we remove intentional suicide attempts from the statistics, we see that the stunt has a 75% survival rate - not too bad.

*How does this translate to a Roblox "Experience"?*

Probably somewhat smoothly. There are plenty of "Experiences" based on repetetive game loops where the repetition earns you resources to make the next repetition smoother, cooler, and more fun.

Some examples:

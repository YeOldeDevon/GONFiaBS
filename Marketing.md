# Marketing

## Audience
People who play Roblox.

## Platform
Roblox.

## Schedule
It shouldn't take more than a month or two to get a demo going (I was going to say a week, but we all have busy lives and whenever I make a schedule estimate it always takes twice as long as my guess, and somebody told me once that you should be doubling your initial schedule estimates anyway, so let's say 4 weeks).

After seeing how catchy the concept is, the game can be modified, updated, maintained, and expanded on perpetually.

## Competition
There are no other roblox experiences about going over Niagara Falls in a barrel.
It is doubtful whether there are any video games at all where the player goes over Niagara Falls (or any waterfall) in a barrel.

Tl;dr
We have no competition in this genre.

We still need to compete with other Roblox Experiences in the player browser, but with a name like *"Going Over Niagara Falls in a Barrel Simulator"* it might not be as difficult as we think to attract an audience. After all, *"Bee Swarm Simulator"* was lame as hell, but the name pulled me in right away and I played it for like three hours. Imagine if that happened with a game that was actually fun.

## Allies
Maybe we can get sponsored by those people who make barrels of pickles.

## Business Model
Since Roblox is built on microtransactions, I assume our business model will revolve around that in some way. There are a number of powerups, upgrades, and cosmetics listed in the [[Parts Data]] section. These can be unlocked in various ways, or bought outright with Robux.
Balancing the cost of something in Robux with the effort required to unlock it will require some research.

It's probably worth checking out how [[Robux]] works.
